  caveats <<~EOS
    The zsh completion is linked into #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/zsh/site-functions.
    zsh loads it once compinit runs with that directory on fpath, and the zsh
    macOS ships runs no compinit. If Tab does not complete coddy, add to ~/.zshrc:
      fpath=(#{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/zsh/site-functions $fpath)
      autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
    and open a new terminal.

    Coddy does not need tmux, but its console runs well inside it: a session
    there outlives a closed terminal or a dropped SSH connection. To add it:
      brew install tmux
